The Neon Role can be imported to the terraform state by the identifier which is composed of the `projectID`, `branchID`
and the Role `name`. For example, the identifier of the Role `myRole` from the branch `br-snowy-mountain-a5jkb18i`
of the project `shiny-cell-31746257` is `shiny-cell-31746257/br-snowy-mountain-a5jkb18i/myRole`.

Import using the [import block](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/import):

For example:

```hcl
import {
  to = neon_role.this
  id = "shiny-cell-31746257/br-snowy-mountain-a5jkb18i/myRole"
}
```

Import using the command `terraform import`:

```commandline
terraform import neon_role.this "shiny-cell-31746257/br-snowy-mountain-a5jkb18i/myRole"
```
