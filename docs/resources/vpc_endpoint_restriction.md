# neon_vpc_endpoint_restriction (Resource)

Sets or updates a VPC endpoint restriction for a Neon project.
When a VPC endpoint restriction is set, the project only accepts connections
from the specified VPC.
A VPC endpoint can be set as a restriction only after it is assigned to the
parent organization of the Neon project.

## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "neon_vpc_endpoint_assignment" "example" {
  org_id          = "org-foo-bar-01234567"
  region_id       = "us-east-1"
  vpc_endpoint_id = "vpce-1234567890abcdef0"
  label           = "example"
}

resource "neon_vpc_endpoint_restriction" "example" {
  project_id      = "cold-bread-99644485"
  vpc_endpoint_id = neon_vpc_endpoint_assignment.example.vpc_endpoint_id
  label           = "example"
}
```

## Import

The VPC endpoint restriction can be imported to the terraform state by its identifier.

Import using the [import block](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/import):

For example:

```hcl
import {
  to = neon_vpc_endpoint_restriction.example
  id = "vpce-1234567890abcdef0/cold-bread-99644485"
}
```

Import using the command `terraform import`:

```commandline
terraform import neon_vpc_endpoint_restriction.example "vpce-1234567890abcdef0/cold-bread-99644485"
```

**Note** that the resource ID is the concatenation of the VPC ID and the project ID separated by the slash sign.
